		<h2>6. C15 Setup (System Settings)</h2>
		
		<p>The C15 also features a few global settings that are preset-independant. They are organized in the Setup menu and mainly define the interaction with peripherals (such as sensivities for velocities, external pedal integration or connected devices via Wi-Fi). Besides, the Setup menu allows for installing updates and transferring backups.<br />Chapter 7.12 provides all information on accessing and navigating the Setup menu both on the Panel Unit and on the Graphical User Interface. The following passages explain all provided menu items.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Device Settings [Hardware UI, Graphical UI]</h3>
		
		<h5>Edit Smoothing Time</h5>
		<p>When editing a parameter, the new adjusted value will be approached within the Edit Smoothing Time, which can range between zero and 200 ms. Higher times will lead to a slower response of the sound engine. This time does not affect preset recalls or modulations (having their own, individual times).</p>
		<h5>Velocity Curve</h5>
		<p>The Velocity Curve determines the sensivity of the instrument for key velocities. A soft setting increases the sensivity for low velocities, a hard setting increases the sensivity for high velocites. With the normal setting, the sensivity remains equal for all velocites.</p>
		<h5>Aftertouch Curve</h5>
		<p>The Aftertouch Curve determines the sensivity of the instrument for Aftertouch gestures. A soft setting increases the sensivity for low aftertouch intensities, a hard setting increases the sensivity for high aftertouch intensities. With the normal setting, the sensivity remains equal throughout.</p>
		<h5>Bender Curve</h5>
		<p>The Bender Curve determines the sensivity of the instrument for Bender gestures. A soft setting increases the sensivity for low bending intensities, a hard setting increases the sensivity for high bending intensities. With the normal setting, the sensivity remains equal throughout.</p>
		<h5>Pedal Settings</h5>
		<p>As described in chapter 08.5, the integration of external pedals can be done manually. For each pedal, the circuit type can be chosen. Nevertheless, we recommend to connect pedals only when the instrument is switched off, in order to avoid a wrong and possibly harmful integration.</p>
		<h5>Preset Glitch Suppression</h5>
		<p>This option is currently not available, being still in development. The intention here is to avoid drastical changing pitches and other emerging artifacts, being provoked by a preset change. The suppression will be realized by clearing (flushing) all delay buffers when a new preset is loaded.</p>		
		
		
		<h3>GUI Settings [Graphical UI only]</h3>
		
		<h5>Edit Smoothing Time</h5>
		<p>A complete reference of the GUI Settings menu, exclusive to the Graphical UI, can be found in chapter 7.15.</p>
		
		
		<h3>GUI Settings [Hardware UI only]</h3>
		
		<h5>Encoder Acceleration</h5>
		<p>The Encoder in the Edit Panel can detect acceleration gestures and apply them to an item in focus accordingly. With sufficient acceleration, even high resolution parameters can be completely traversed with only one or a few turns of the encoder.</p>
		<h5>Ribbon Relative Factor</h5>
		<p>Similarly, drag gestures on the two Ribbon touchstrips can be amplified by the Ribbon Relative Factor. This option is only effective, when a Ribbon is in relative mode.</p>
		<h5>Signal Flow Indication</h5>
		<p>As described in chapter 07.8, the Flow Overview allows for a fast and easy impression on how signals of a preset are routed. However, blinking LEDs may distract the user in some cases, therefore the Flow Overview is optional.</p>


		<h3>System Info [Hardware UI, Graphical UI]</h3>

		<h5>Device Name</h5>
		<p>The Device Name of the C15 instrument can be chosen by the user. It will appear in the meta data of presets and determine the SSID of the Wi-Fi network. In order to complete the renaming process, restart the instrument afterwards.</p>
		<h5>SSID</h5>
		<p>During the booting process, the SSID will be generated according to the Device Name. A Wi-Fi network with the SSID should be available after booting. Besides the Device Name, the SSID contains a static prefix („NL-C15-“). When establishing a Wi-Fi connection, choose the network with the corresponding SSID.</p>		
		<h5>Passphrase</h5>
		<p>The secured Wi-Fi connection has to be confirmed by a passphrase. This passphrase can be seen and changed in the System Info (effective after rebooting). Note that the passphrase cannot be chosen, it will be randomly generated.</p>
		<h5>Free Internal Memory</h5>
		<p>The remaining free disk space is displayed in order to see, if the instrument is capable of holding more presets.</p>
		<h5>Software Version</h5>
		<p>For developers, the versions of integrated components is displayed as well.</p>
		<h5>Date / Time</h5>
		<p>The instrument contains its own system clock, which will be included in preset meta data in the form of timestamps. It can be adjusted as well.</p>
		<h5>Update Available</h5>
		<p>The final menu entry is an indicator for an available update, if a USB stick containing that update was plugged in. This can be used to test, if the update file is valid before actually updating (see Notes on Software Updates).</p>
		
		<h3>About [Hardware UI, Graphical UI]</h3>

		<p>In the About section, the Nonlinear Labs developer team is listed.</p>

		<h3>Backup [Hardware UI only]</h3>

		<h5>USB Available</h5>
		<p>In order to backup all banks or restore a preexisting backup, a USB stick has to be plugged in. The „USB Available“ indicator shows if a USB stick is currently present.</p>
		
		<h5>Restore</h5>
		<p>In order to restore a previously created backup, enter this option. You will be warned that all present data on your instrument will be overwritten. When accepting, all available backups on the present USB stick will be shown and the desired backup file can be selected. Restoring may take some time, depending on the backup file size.</p>
		<h5>Export</h5>
		<p>In order to export all currently present banks as a backup file, enter this option. The process may take some time, depending on the number of presets and banks currently present on the instrument. A backup file will be created on the present USB stick, which can be restored at any time.</p>
