		<h2>7.&ensp;Updating the C15</h2>

		<p>New software versions will be made available as downloads on the Nonlinear Labs website. For an update of your C15 please follow the protocol below step by step:<br /><br />
<b>(1)&nbsp;</b> Select the desired update in the <a href="http://www.nonlinear-labs.de/#">download area</a> of the Nonlinear Labs website and download it to your computer.<br /><br />
<b>(2)&nbsp;</b> Connect the USB stick which is included in the C15 package to your computer.</p>
		
		<div class="note">The included USB stick of the C15 package has a special format – other USB sticks will not work for C15 updates.</div>
		
<p>
<b>(3)&nbsp;</b> The downloaded file will be a .zip archive. It contains a file named „nonlinear-c15-update.tar“, which should be extracted onto the top directory of the USB stick (typically by opening the .zip file via double-click and dragging the .tar file correspondingly).<br /><br />
<b>(4)&nbsp;</b> Switch off the C15 and plug the USB stick to the USB connector on the backside of the Base Unit. Then start the C15.<br /><br />
<b>(5)&nbsp;</b> An automatic update process will start, as indicated on the Base Unit Display. When the shown status indicates that the update has finished, switch off the C15.<br /><br />
<b>(6)&nbsp;</b> The USB stick can be removed now. After a successful installation, the update file on the USB stick will have been renamed to „nonlinear-c15-update.tar-copied“. It should be deleted before the next update.<br /><br />
When starting the C15 again, it will run the new software version.<br />Besides, the C15 can display if a valid update file is found on the USB stick, which will be useful prior to installing updates. This can be seen in the System Info section of the Setup Menu, as there is an „Update Available“ entry at the bottom.<br />We recommend to always have the latest version installed, but it is also possible to downgrade to a previous version by running the described installation process with the .zip file for that version. However, preset compability is only guaranteed if updating to newer versions. Presets created with a newer version may be corrupted when loading them with an older version.</p>
