		<h2>2. Setting up the C15</h2>

<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->			

			<h3>2.1 Mounting the Panel Unit</h3>
			
			<span id="baseunit-1"></span>
			<p class="mb3">Ensure the C15 is switched off  before following the next four steps:</p>

				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2650-b.jpg" alt="2650-b">
				<p>1. Attach mounting brackets to Base Unit by hanging and snapping.</p>

				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2644.jpg" alt="2644">				
				<p>2. Place Panel Unit on fixated mounting brackets. There are two screws (mount- ing pins) on the bottom side of the Panel Unit fitting into corresponding holes near the peak of each mounting bracket</p>

				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2655.jpg" alt="2655">				
				<p>3. Connect panel unit to base unit by plugging the panel connector cable into both unit’s connector sockets.</p>

				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2656.jpg" alt="2656">				
				<p>4. Connect Base Unit and Panel Unit with the unit connector cable.</p>
		
			<p>Now the C15 is ready to use and can be switched on.</p>
			<p>In order to disassemble the paired setup, follow this protocol by applying the described four steps in reverse manner and order. The C15 Base Unit can be used on its own as well.</p>

<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->	<span id="connect"></span>					
			
			<h3>2.2 Connections</h3>
			
			<p>Besides the panel connector cable, the following external connections are provided by the main unit:</p>
			
				<span id="headphones"></span>	
				<h5 class="header">Headphones</h5>
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2658.jpg" alt="headphones">
				<p>The headphone output provides a standard unbalanced 6.3 mm stereo headphone socket with separate, preset-independent adjustable headphone level.</p>
				
				<span id="audioout"></span>	
				<h5 class="header">Audio Output</h5>
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2659.jpg" alt="audio-out-level">
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2242.jpg" alt="audio-out">
				<p>The audio output provides two standard balanced 6.3 mm line-level audio sockets with separate, preset-independent adjustable output level.</p>
				
				<span id="pedals"></span>
				<h5 class="header">Pedals</h5>
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2241.jpg" alt="pedals">
				<p>Four standard 6.3 mm pedal sockets are provided for external pedal control. In general, any keyboard controller pedal can be connected.
				<i>Nevertheless, only continuous pedals allow for a nuanced performance and are therefore recommended.</i></p>
					
					
				<h5 class="header">USB</h5>
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2240.jpg" alt="usb">
				<p>The USB connection allows for plugging in the USB stick, which is part of the C15 package. Via USB, preset banks can be transferred and updates can be installed.</p>
				
				<h5 class="header">Power</h5>
				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2249-a.jpg" alt="power">
				<p>The C15 comes with its own external power adapter, which can be connected to the corresponding appliance inlet. If power is provided, a small LED next to the inlet will indicate that the C15 is ready to be switched on.</p>

<!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->			
			
			<h3>2.3 Start and Shutdown</h3>

				<img class="img-frame" src="images/2249-b.jpg" alt="start">			
				<p>Turn on the C15 by pressing the power button. The boot process will take several seconds before the device is ready to use. The last settings will be loaded on startup. To shut down the C15, press the power button. The shutdown process will take several seconds, storing the current settings for the next startup, before the device will turn off.</p>
				<div class="note">Ensure that the power supply is not interrupted when using the C15 (booting, performance, shutdown) in order to prevent data loss.</div>

			<h3>2.4 Setting up a device for the Graphical User Interface</h3>

			<img class="img-frame" src="images/3732.jpg" alt="WebUI Device">
			<div class="mb2"></div>
			
				<h5>Concept</h5><span id="baseunit-2"></span>
				<p>The C15 is designed to be of flexible usage and interaction, requiring at least the base unit for connections and performance. In addition, the panel unit provides the hardware user interface and therefore access to all parameters, presets and settings.<br />Finally, the base unit also provides a Wi-Fi hotspot in order to connect external devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. When connected, the graphical user interface can be accessed by using a browser from
the external device. Multiple external devices can be connected simultaneously, each capable of showing different features. However, only one Parameter can be
focussed at a time, synchronizing the hardware user interface with every connected 17 external device.<br />
Furthermore, the Wi-Fi connection allows for preset interchange and therefore the possibility of backing up preset banks to the external device. The C15 user manual is also accessible in the browser.</p>

				<h5>System Requirements</h5>
				<p>Due to the browser-based implementation of the graphical user interface, there are almost no limitations concerning compatibility between operating systems or browsers. Basically, the only required device functionalities are the device being capable of a Wi-Fi connection and an installed browser.<br />
However, in the wide variety of devices, operating systems and browsers, there may be some restrictions and optimal performance can not be guaranteed. Differences between browsers, fast technological advances and frequent updates contribute to a complex situation, in which it is increasingly hard to state what is suitable.<br />Nevertheless, there are some experiences that emerged during development and can be expressed as a recommendation, or understood as minimal requirements:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The device should run at least with a 1 GHz processing unit and 2 GB RAM space.</li>
					<li>The device display should support multi touch, or a mouse should be connected.
					A connected or integrated keyboard is useful in the Graphical User Interface.</li>
					<li>The device display should span at least 7’’ diagonally.</li>
					<li>Although the choice of the browser is completely up to the user, the best perfor-
					mance will be achieved by using a Google Chrome browser.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="note">If you encounter problems with your setup, there are some things you can do. If possible, try to restart or change to another browser (or device). If not, or if the problem won’t disappear, contact us directly.<br />We appreciate feedback and reports of dysfunctionalities and will try to solve problems quickly.</div>
		
				<h5>Wi-Fi Settings</h5>
				<p>In order to set all relevant aspects of a well defined Wi-Fi connection, enter the setup menu on the Hardware User Interface (Setup button) and navigate to System Info. Here, all relevant aspects of the Wi-Fi connection are listed:</p>
				
				<ul>				
				<li><b>Device Name</b><br />
				You can give a name to your C15 instrument by focussing on the device name entry and pressing enter, accessing the Rename Screen. Once the name is set, an SSID will be gen- erated. The SSID is composed of a prefix (“NL-C15-”) and the name you just gave to the instrument.</li>
				
				<li><b>SSID</b><br />
				A Wi-Fi network with the same name as the SSID will be provided once you scan for available networks on your external device. When connecting to this network, your external device will be able to control the C15 over a browser. The SSID is generated once during the booting process, so renaming your device will require restarting.</li>
				
				<li><b>Passphrase</b><br />
				The network connection is secured, so a passphrase is needed in order to establish a connection. When connecting to the network from your external device, use the displayed passphrase to confirm. The passphrase can be randomly generated by focussing on the corresponding entry and pressing enter. The command “generate new” has to be selected and executed. If you suspect that the passphrase isn't secure anymore (because it has been shared with someone), a new passphrase should be generated.</li>
				
				<li><b>Address</b><br /><span id="address"></span>
<em>192.168.8.2:8080</em><br />Once the connection is established, post and submit the address into your browser’s address bar and the graphical user interface should appear in your browser.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class="note">If you encounter problems navigating the Setup menu intuitively, please refer to chapters “7. User Interfaces” and “9. Setup”.</div>


				<h5>Browser-specific issues</h5>
				<p>As already mentioned, there may be restrictions on some browsers, as there is no real standard on functionality. We try to keep track of browser-specific issues and offer solutions, if there are any. As for now, the following issues have been found:</p>
				
				<ul>				
				<li><b>Microsoft Edge</b><br />
				By default, touch events are disabled in Microsoft Edge. In order to enable them, type „about:flags“ in the address bar and navigate the provided site down to „touch events“. Select „always active“ in the dropdown menu.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>2.5 Pedal Integration</h3>
			<p>As mentioned, the safe way of integrating pedals into the system would be when the C15 is switched off. After all connections were made, the C15 can be switched on and all connected pedals will be recognized and integrated accordingly. For more information about pedal integration, refer to chapter 5.5.</p>
