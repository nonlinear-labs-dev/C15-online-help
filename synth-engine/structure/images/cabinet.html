			<p>The second effect is called „Cabinet“, providing the possibility to further shape the signal in terms of saturation, overdrive and distortion. It can be regarded as a basic amp simulator.<br />A sine shaper (providing Drive, Fold and Asymetry, as described for the branch Shapers) is the central element of this effect, allowing for the creation of new harmonics to the signal. Before and after the actual shaping, filtering is applied in order to further manipulate the distortion effect. The signal passes through a highpass filter with adjustable frequency (cutting low signal components) before being fed into the shaper. After the shaping, a lowpass filter with adjustable frequency determines the amount of high signal components (boosted by the distortion).<br />A Tilt parameter has a further influence on the signal spectrum before and after the shaping, as it can emphasize either low or high signal components that will be affected by the shaper.<br />The shaped signal can be amplified by a separate „Cab Level“ parameter, before being crossfaded with the input signal by the Mix parameter.</p>
