			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			
			<p>The C15 is an instrument for the performing musician, designed for playability and detailed sound editing. Its unique sound character spans from crisp and organic to complex and experimental. The top-quality semi-weighted keybed drives a digital synthesis engine responding with a wide spectrum of sound colors and intensities.</p>
<p>As a dedicated real-time instrument, the C15 is built for human control. There are no modulation sources or sequencing modules to create rhythmic patterns — we leave this to the musician. Instead, the C15 is a decidedly responsive instrument which combines high-resolution keys, ribbons, and pedal inputs.</p>
<p>Every parameter on the C15 can be directly selected by a button. In other words, all functions are so ware-defined but have a dedicated haptic control surface. In addition, a graphical user interface can be displayed and edited on any device that has a browser and Wi-Fi.
Like many classical instrument builders, we have chosen wood for most parts of the housing. All other parts are made of steel or aluminium. Along with the excellent keyboard, there is a specially-designed ergonomic pitch bender, two very long touchstrips (ribbons), and inputs for up to four pedals.</p>

			<h3>About the Manual Content</h3>
			
<p>The following chapters refer to di erent important aspects of working with the C15 instrument. Each chapter tries to exclude the „broader picture“ by focussing only on the crucial related aspects. Nevertheless, this manual attempts to cover as many details as possible.
When using this manual, it may be helpful to first be certain about your aspect of interest, before actually looking something up. The following overview may help clarifying:
</p>

<h4>2. Setting up the C15</h4>
<p>At least for the first attempt of putting all components together, consider reading this chapter describing the whole process.</p>

<h4>3. Basic Concepts</h4>
<p>This chapter outlines a general approach to the C15 instrument, explaining how to perform, how the modulation mechanism works and how everything is organized.</p>

<h4>4. User Interfaces</h4>
<p>This chapter explains how to actually work with the instrument. Methods of navigation, editing and preset access are described in detail for each available interface.</p>

<h4>5. The Synthesis Engine</h4>
<p>All signal- or DSP- related aspects are subject of this chapter, including details on signal synthesis and flow, a complete and detailed parameter reference and tutorials. Details on the integration of Hardware Sources is part of the parameter reference.</p>

<h4>6. Setup (C15 System Settings)</h4>
<p>When already familiar with the instrument, the setup chapter provides insight into the advanced system settings of the C15.</p>

<h4>7. Troubleshooting and Usage Guidelines</h4>
<p>If you encounter problems or issues, refer to this chapter. A list of common and known issues is included, possibly providing a solution to yours. The usage guide- lines attempt to provide ways to avoid certain issues from emerging.</p>
